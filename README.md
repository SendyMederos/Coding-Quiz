When the quiz starts a timer starts to count down at the top right of the website and a series of questions and answers will display.
When an answer is selected a message of “right” or “wrong” appears for a second and a half, and it goes to the next question and possible answers.

When all the questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, the game is over and you can save your initials. 
When scores are saved, past scores will display starting with the highest score.
Then an option of clearing the scores and restarting the game will appear at the bottom of the list.
